# This is a configuration file for working with Operator remotely using Openshift.
# The docker builds (based on Rhel image) are pushed to the ECR registry.
# Note, that to work with Openshift you need to:
# * import current e2e cluster connection details (
# * login to the cluster using token
# (get the login command from https://master.openshift-cluster.mongokubernetes.com:8443/console/catalog)
#
# Parameters:
# - CLUSTER_TYPE: the type of Kubernetes cluster. Possible values are "kops", "minikube", "openshift"
# - CLUSTER_NAME: the name of kubectl context. Will be created as soon as relevant kubernetes cluster is created
# - REPO_URL: the url of docker registry used to store docker images
# - NAMESPACE: (optional) the name of Kubernetes namespace that will be created. Note, that the group name
#              in Ops Manager will have the same name. It's recommended to have different namespace names for different
#              contexts to avoid Ops Manager clashing. "mongodb" by default
#              If you change Namespace for existing configuration - make sure you delete the previous namespace!
# - OPERATOR_VERSION: (optional) the version of images to be downloaded. Must be specified only if official image
#              registry is used (quay.io)
# - MONGODB_RESOURCES: (optional) the list of yaml config files that will be applied automatically after each "make full"
#               run. For example "MONGODB_RESOURCES="rs.yaml; rs2.yaml"
# - OPS_MANAGER_PACKAGE_URL: the url which is used to download Ops Manager debian package for 'make om-evg' task. If
#              not specified some default one will be used (check 'ensure_ops_manager_evg' script).
