# This is a configuration file for working with Operator remotely using Kops
# The docker builds are pushed to the ECR registry
#
# Parameters:
# - CLUSTER_TYPE: the type of Kubernetes cluster. Possible values are "kops", "minikube", "openshift"
# - CLUSTER_NAME: the name of kubectl context. Will be created as soon as relevant kubernetes cluster is created
# - REPO_URL: the url of docker registry used to store docker images
# - NAMESPACE: (optional) the name of Kubernetes namespace that will be created. Note, that the group name
#              in Ops Manager will have the same name. It's recommended to have different namespace names for different
#              contexts to avoid Ops Manager clashing. "mongodb" by default
#              If you change Namespace for existing configuration - make sure you delete the previous namespace!
# - OPERATOR_VERSION: (optional) the version of images to be downloaded. Must be specified only if official image
#              registry is used (quay.io)
# - MONGODB_RESOURCES: (optional) the list of yaml config files that will be applied automatically after each "make full"
#               run. For example "MONGODB_RESOURCES="rs.yaml; rs2.yaml"
# - KOPS_ZONES: (optional, only if CLUSTER_TYPE is set to 'kops'). Overrides default zones for kops cluster. May be
#              necessary if the default region (us-east) has engaged all VPCs up to the limit (5 by default)

# IMPORTANT: this file is just an example, you need to change the values proper way
