# MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator 1.15.2
## MongoDBOpsManager Resource
* Bug Fix 
  * For enabling custom TLS certificates for S3 Oplog and Snapshot stores for backup. In additioning to setting `spec.security.tls.ca` and `spec.security.tls.secretRef`. The field `spec.backup.s3OpLogStores[n].customCertificate` / `spec.backup.s3Stores[n].customCertificate` needs to be set `true`. 

# MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator 1.15.1

## MongoDBOpsManager Resource

* Bug fixes
  * Fixes an issue that prevented the Operator to be upgraded when managing a TLS
    enabled ApplicationDB, when the ApplicationDB TLS certificate is stored in a
    `Secret` of type Opaque.

<!-- Past Releases -->
# MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator 1.15.0


## MongoDB Resource

* Changes:
  * The `spec.security.tls.enabled` and `spec.security.tls.secretRef.prefix` fields are now **deprecated** and will be removed in a future release. To enable TLS it is now sufficient to set the `spec.security.certsSecretPrefix` field.

## MongoDBOpsManager Resource

* Changes:
  * A new field has been added: `spec.backup.queryableBackupSecretRef`. The secrets referenced by this field contains the certificates used to enable [Queryable Backups](https://docs.opsmanager.mongodb.com/current/tutorial/query-backup/) feature.
  * Added support for configuring custom TLS certificates for the S3 Oplog and Snapshot Stores for backup. These can be configured with
  `spec.security.tls.ca` and `spec.security.tls.secretRef`.
  * It is possible to disable AppDB processes via the `spec.applicationDatabase.automationConfig.processes[n].disabled` field, this enables backing up the AppDB.
  * The `spec.security.tls.enabled`, `spec.security.tls.secretRef.prefix`, `spec.applicationDatabase.security.tls.enabled` and `spec.applicationDatabase.security.tls.prefix` fields are now **deprecated** and will be removed in a future release. To enable TLS it is now sufficient to set the `spec.security.certsSecretPrefix` and/or `spec.applicationDatabase.security.certsSecretPrefix` field.

# MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator 1.14.0


## MongoDB Resource
* Changes:
  * A new field has been added: `spec.backup.autoTerminateOnDeletion`. AutoTerminateOnDeletion indicates if the Operator should stop and terminate the Backup before the cleanup, when the MongoDB Resource is deleted.
* Bug fixes
  * Fixes an issue which would make a ShardedCluster Resource fail when disabling authentication.

## MongoDBOpsManager Resource

* Bug Fixes
  * Fixes an issue where the operator would not properly trigger a reconciliation when rotating the AppDB TLS Certificate.
  * Fixes an issue where a custom CA specified in the MongoDBOpsManager resource was not mounted into the Backup Daemon pod,
  which prevented backups from working when Ops Manager was configured in hybrid mode and used a custom CA.
* Changes
  * Added support for configuring S3 Oplog Stores using the `spec.backup.s3OpLogStores` field.


# MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator 1.13.0

## Kubernetes Operator
* Breaking Changes:
  * The Operator no longer generates certificates for TLS resources.
* When deploying to multiple namespaces, imagePullSecrets has to be created only in the namespace where the Operator is installed. From here, the Operator will be sync this secret across all watched namespaces.
* The credentials secret used by the Operator now accepts the pair of fields `publicKey` and `privateKey`. These should be preferred to the existent `user` and `publicApiKey` when using Programmatic API Keys in Ops Manager.
* For TLS-enabled resources, the operator now watches the ConfigMap containing the Certificate Authority and the secret containg the TLS certificate. Changes to these resources now trigger a reconciliation of the related resource.
* The Operator can now watch over a list of Namespaces. To install the Operator in this mode, you need to set the value `operator.watchNamespace` to a comma-separated list of Namespaces.
  The Helm install process will create Roles and Service Accounts required, in the Namespaces that the Operator will be watching.

### Support for TLS certificates provided as kubernetes.io/tls secrets
* The operator now supports referencing TLS secrets of type kubernetes.io/tls
  * This type of secrets contain a tls.crt and tls.key entry
  * The operator can read these secrets and automatically generate a new one, containing the concatenation of tls.crt and tls.key
  * This removes the need for a manual concatenation of the fields and enables users to natively reference secrets generated by tools such as cert-manager

**Deprecation Notice**
The usage of generic secrets, manually created by concatenating certificate and private key, is now deprecated.

## MongoDB Resource
* Breaking Changes:
  * The field `spec.project` has been removed from MongoDB spec, this field has been deprecated since operator version `1.3.0`. Make sure to specify the project configmap name under `spec.opsManager.configMapRef.name` or ``spec.cloudManager.configMapRef.name`` before upgrading the operator.
* Changes:
  * A new field has been added: `spec.security.certsSecretPrefix`. This string is now used to determine the name of the secrets containing various TLS certificates:
    * For TLS member certificates, the secret name is `<spec.security.certsSecretPrefix>-<resource-name>-cert`
      * Note: If either `spec.security.tls.secretRef.name` or `spec.security.tls.secretRef.prefix` are specified, these will take precedence over the new field
      * Note: if none of these three fields are specified, the secret name is `<resource-name>-cert`
    * For agent certificates, if `spec.security.certsSecretPrefix` is specified, the secret name is`<spec.security.certsSecretPrefix>-<resource-name>-agent-certs`
      * Note: if `spec.authentication.agents.clientCertificateSecretRef` is specified, this will take precedence over the new field
      * If none of these fields are set, the secret name is still `agent-certs`
    * For internal cluster authentication certificates, if `spec.security.certsSecretPrefix` is specified, the secret name is `<spec.security.certsSecretPrefix>-<resource-name>-clusterfile`
      * Otherwise, it is still `<resource-name>-clusterfile`
* Bug fixes
  * Fixes an issue where Sharded Cluster backups could not be correctly configured using the MongoDB CR.
  * Fixes an issue where Backup Daemon fails to start after OpsManager version upgrade.


## MongoDBOpsManager Resource
* Operator will report status of FileSystemSnaphot store names configured under `spec.backup.fileSystemStores` in OM CR. The FS however needs to be manually configured.
* It is now possible to disable creation of "LoadBalancer" Type service for queryable backup by setting `spec.backup.externalServiceEnabled` to `false` in OM CR. By default, the operator would create the LoadBalancer type service object.
* The operator will now automatically upgrade the used API Key to a programmatic one when deploying OM >= 5.0.0. It is now possible to upgrade from older versions of OM to OM 5.0 without manual intervention.
* A new field has been added: `spec.security.certSecretPrefix`. This is string is now used to determine the name of the secret containing the TLS certificate for OpsManager.
  * If the existing field `spec.security.tls.secretRef.Name` is specified, it will take the precedence
    * Please note that this field is now **deprecated** and will be removed in a future release
  * Otherwise, if `spec.security.certSecretPrefix` is specified, the secret name will be `<spec.security.certSecretPrefix>-<om-resource-name>-cert`

## MongoDBUser Resource
* Breaking Changes:
  * The field `spec.project` has been removed from User spec, this field has been deprecated since operator version `1.3.0`. Make sure to specify the MongoDB resource name under `spec.MongoDBResourceRef.name` before upgrading the operator.
## Miscellaneous
* Ops Manager versions 4.4.7, 4.4.9, 4.4.10, 4.4.11, 4.4.12 and 4.4.13 base images have been updated to Ubuntu 20.04.
* Ops Manager versions 4.4.16 and 5.0.1 are now supported


# MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator 1.12.0

## MongoDB Resource
* Bug Fixes
  * Fixes a bug when an user could only specify `net.ssl.mode` and not `net.tls.mode` in the `spec.additionalMongodConfig` field.
* Changes
  * If `spec.exposedExternally` is set to `false` after being set to `true`, the Operator will now delete the corresponding service

## MongoDBOpsManager Resource
* Changes
  * If `spec.externalConnectivity` is unset after being set, the Operator will now delete the corresponding service
  * It is now possible to specify the number of backup daemon pods to deploy through the `spec.backup.members` field. The value defaults to 1 if not set.


## Miscellaneous
* Ops Manager versions 4.4.13, 4.4.14, 4.4.15 and 4.2.25 are now supported
* Ops Manager version 5.0.0 is now supported
* Ubuntu based operator images are now based on Ubuntu 20.04 instead of Ubuntu 16.04
* Ubuntu based database images starting from 2.0.1 will be based on Ubuntu 18.04 instead of Ubuntu 16.04
  **NOTE: MongoDB 4.0.0 does not support Ubuntu 18.04 - If you want to use MongoDB 4.0.0, stay on previously released images**
* Ubuntu based Ops Manager images after 4.4.13 will be based on Ubuntu 20.04 instead of Ubuntu 16.04

* Newly released ubi images for Operator, Ops Manager and Database will be based un ubi-minimal instead of ubi
## Notes before upgrading to OpsManager 5.0.0
* Before upgrading OpsManager to version 5.0.0 make sure the Operator is using a [programmatic API key](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/tutorial/create-operator-credentials/#create-k8s-credentials). This is only required when the OpsManager instance is managed by the Operator.
* You will find a small tutorial on how to do this in [upgrading-to-ops-manager-5.md](docs/upgrading-to-ops-manager-5.md) document.

# MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator 1.11.0

## MongoDB Resource
* Bug fixes
  * Fixes an issue with the `LivenessProbe` that could cause the database Pods to be restarted in the middle of a restore operation from Backup.

## MongoDBOpsManager Resource
* Breaking Changes
  *For a complete guide on how to safely upgrade, please check the [upgrade instructions](link here TODO)*
  * Each Application Database pod consists now of three containers (`mongodb`, `mongodb-agent`, `mongodb-agent-monitoring`) and it does not bundle anymore a MongoDB version
  * You can now use any version of MongoDB for the Application Database (we recommend to use the enterprise ones provided by MongoDB, see the *New Images* section)
    * You need to make sure the MongoDB version used is [supported](https://docs.opsmanager.mongodb.com/current/reference/mongodb-compatibility/) by OpsManager
  * `spec.applicationDatabase.version` is no longer optional.
  * `spec.applicationDatabase.persistent` does not exist anymore, the Operator will now always use persistent volumes for the AppDB.

# MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator 1.10.1

## Kubernetes Operator
* Changes
  * Added a liveness probe to the Backup Daemon.
  * Added a readiness probe to the Backup Daemon.
  * The readiness probe on Database Pods is more strict when restarting a
      Replica Set and will only set the Pod as "Ready" when the MongoDB server has
      reached `PRIMARY` or `SECONDARY` states.

## MongoDB Resource
* Changes
  * Deprecated field `spec.security.tls.secretRef.name`, the field `spec.security.tls.secretRef.prefix` should now be used instead.
  * Added field `spec.security.tls.secretRef.prefix`. This property should be used to specify the prefix of the secret which contains custom tls certificates.

## MongoDBOpsManager Resource
* Changes
  * A new status field for the OpsManager backup has been added: `Disabled`. This status will be displayed when `spec.backup.enabled` is set to `false` and no backup is configured in OpsManager

## Miscellaneous
* Added a new value in openshift-values.yaml `operator_image_name` which allows the label selector of the webhook
  to match the operator label.


## MongoDB Resource
* Changes
  * Deprecated field `spec.security.tls.secretRef.name`, the field `spec.security.tls.secretRef.prefix` should now be used instead.

## MongoDBOpsManager Resource

* Known issues
  * When using remote or hybrid mode, and `automation.versions.download.baseUrl` has been set, the property `automation.versions.download.baseUrl.allowOnlyAvailableBuilds`
    needs to be set to `false`. This has been fixed in Ops Manager version 4.4.11.

# MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator 1.9.2
## Miscellaneous
* Fix errors with CSV



# MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator 1.9.1
## Kubernetes Operator
* Bug fixes
  * Fixes an issue where the service-account-name could not be specified in the StatefulSet podSpec override.
  * Removed unnecessary `delete service` permission from operator role.

## MongoDB Resource
* Bug fixes
  * Fixes an issue where updating a role in `spec.security.authentication.roles` by removing the `privileges` array would cause the resource to enter a bad state

## MongoDBOpsManager Resource
* Breaking Changes
  * The new Application Database image `mongodb-enterprise-appdb:10.2.15.5958-1_4.2.11-ent` was released. The image needs
  to be downloaded to the local repositories otherwise MongoDBOpsManager resource won't start. The image contains a new bundled MongoDB
  `4.2.11-ent` instead of `4.2.2-ent`.
* Changes
  * Ops Manager user now has "backup", "restore" and "hostManager" roles, allowing for backups/restores on the AppDB.
  * If `spec.applicationDatabase.version` is omitted the Operator will use `4.2.11-ent` as a default MongoDB.

# MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator 1.9.0

## Kubernetes Operator

* Bug fixes
  * Fixes an issue where connections were not closed leading to too many file
   descriptors open.

## MongoDB Resource
* Changes
  * Continuous backups can now be configured with the MongoDB CRD. Set `spec.backup.enabled` to `true`. *Note*: You must have an Ops Manager resource already configured with backup. See [the docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/master/tutorial/deploy-om-container/#id6) for more information.
## MongoDBOpsManager Resource

* Changes
  * A StatefulSet resource that holds the Ops Manager Backup Daemon will be
   deleted and recreated in order to change the `matchLabels` attribute,
   required for a new `Service` to allow for Queryable Backups feature to work.
   This is a safe operation.
  * Changed the way the Operator collects statuses of MongoDB Agents running in
  Application Database Pods.

# MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator 1.8.2

## MongoDBOpsManager Resource

* Bug Fixes
  * Fixes an issue when `MongoDBOpsManager` resource gets to `Failing` state when
   both external connectivity and backups are enabled.
