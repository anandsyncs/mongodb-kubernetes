# Ops Manager Operator #

<img align="left" src="https://mongodb-kubernetes-operator.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Leaf-Forest%402x.png">

This is a Kubernetes Operator (https://coreos.com/operators/) to work
with Ops Manager and Kubernetes clusters. It allows you to easily add new
MongoDB deployments (standalones, replica sets, sharded clusters) to your Kubernetes cluster, configure them (modify, scale up/down, remove) and to manage them from your
Ops Manager installation. This provides the combined power of Kubernetes (native scheduling of applications to nodes, scaling, fault tolerance etc) with Ops Manager capabilities (monitoring, backup, upgrades etc).

## Development
